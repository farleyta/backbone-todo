# Backbone.js ToDo App – Tim Farley

Yet another Backbone.js ToDo app. I'm following along with Exercise 1 of [http://addyosmani.github.io/backbone-fundamentals/](), but using my own [Backbone Starter Boilerplate](https://github.com/farleyta/backbone-starter).

## Test it online

This project can be seen online here: [http://farleyta.github.io/backbone-todo/]() – it uses your browser's localStorage to keep track of ToDos, so you can close out and revisit later to see your data persist.
